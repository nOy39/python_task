# Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area.
#
# Python: Area of a triangle
#
# A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry.
# A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted triangle ABC.
#
# Vertex of a triangle: The point at which two sides of a triangle meet.
# Altitude of a triangle: The perpendicular segment from a vertex of a triangle to the line containing the opposite side.
# Base of a triangle: The side of a triangle to which an altitude is drawn.
# Height of a triangle: The length of an altitude.

base, height = 10, 14
print(f'Area of triangle is - {1/2 * base * height}')
